# MvcContrib-grid-with-razor-view-and-entity-framework6
In this article I am going to discuss how to bind data from database to MVCContrib Grid. The MVCContrib Grid component provides a strongly-typed way to build an HTML table using a fluent interface and lambda expressions. The MVCContrib Grid belong to MvcContrib.UI.Grid namespace and can be accessed by calling the Html.Grid extension method.Basically MVCContrib Grid is used to display data on a web page using HTML table elements. It renders data in tabular format and also supports custom formatting of columns, paging and sorting. http://www.techstrikers.com/Articles/mvccontrib-grid-with-razor-view-and-entity-framework6.php
